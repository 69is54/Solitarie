## Commit rules:

feature: This prefix is used for commits that introduce new features or functionality to the codebase.

fix: Commits with this prefix are meant for bug fixes. They address and resolve issues or defects in the code.

chore: This prefix is for routine tasks, maintenance, or general codebase improvements that don't fall into the other categories.

docs: Commits with this prefix update or add documentation. This could be code comments, README files, or other documentation-related changes.

refactor: Commits with this prefix indicate code refactoring. This means restructuring or optimizing code without adding new features or fixing bugs.

test: These commits involve changes or additions to the test suite, including unit tests, integration tests, or test-related configurations.

build: These commits are related to build system changes, dependencies, or package management. They include updates to build scripts or configurations.
